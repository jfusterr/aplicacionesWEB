                    Bagpipes from Baghdad. Somebody turn the vacancy sign on. 'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my. Bagpipes
                    from Baghdad. I run the streets. And act like a madman holding a Glad.

                    liquor. Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker. Than a shock when I get shocked at the

                    I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter. But I thought a song would
                    probably be a little better. Instead of a ,letter. That you'd probably just shred up--yeah. I
                    stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of. How much of a waste it'd ,be
                    for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece a. Paper, I'd rather let you see how. Much I fucking hate
                    you in a freestyle.

                <p>My tea's gone cold. I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window.
                    And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It
                    reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.

                    the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just lettin' you know that you're not alone. Holla if you
                    feel like you've been down the same road.
